## General Info:

This is a small project that allows you to work with Classes in Python. 

The logic lies in creating an instance of the class Bingo, then, by calling the main method, it creates a dictionary for each player, then it creates a personal Bingo carton for each player and finally resolves who the winners are.

This program checks edge cases where the user tries to insert a letter or a number out of the range. The range is set to not force the computer ability to run a code.
